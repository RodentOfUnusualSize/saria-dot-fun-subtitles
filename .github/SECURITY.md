# Security policy

First, let me thank you for helping me make my projects safer! 🤎

I am a hobbyist coder.
My projects are for personal fun and learning.
Nothing I create is intended for professional use, or for use on production or public-facing systems.
No warranties or guarantees of any kind are provided for anything.
Everything is “use at your own risk”.

That being said, I take security very seriously.
I would be heartbroken if someone used one of my project’s code, and suffered a security breach or data loss because of it.
So if you find any security concerns in any of my projects, please report them to me! 🙇🏾‍♀️


## Supported versions

None yet.
This project is still in early development.


## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use [the project repository’s issues system][repo-issues-url] to create a new issue for any security vulnerabilities.
Please use the “security concern” template when creating the issue.

All reports using GitHub issues will be public.
If you are concerned about this, and would prefer to privately report a potential security vulnerability, there are several ways you can get in touch with me:

  * You could create a new security concern issue, but *not* disclose what the concern actually is.
    Instead, leave a way to get in touch with you.
    I will be automatically notified about the issue.
  * You could contact me via the fediverse (Mastodon, Pleroma, MissKey, etc.).
    I can be found at [`saria@social.saria.fun`][fediverse-url].

I will try to respond to you within 7 days (though, usually much quicker).


## Disclosure policy

Because this project is not intended for professional or production use, I see no reason to keep security vulnerabilities private.
All known vulnerabilities in the current version of the project will be visible as issues in [the project repository’s issues system][repo-issues-url].

Privately-reported vulnerabilities will not necessarily be publicized immediately, but they will definitely be publicized the moment a fix is available.
If a fix cannot be made available in a reasonable amount of time (depending on the severity of a vulnerability, but no longer than a month), then the vulnerability will be reported regardless of whether a fix is available.

Credit for reporting the vulnerability will be given as soon as the vulnerability is publicized.
